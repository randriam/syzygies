- legacy:  
magma scripts that were used to compute examples for the paper "The syzygy distinguisher" (not meant to be shared initially)

- linear_resolutions:  
improved algorithms to compute linear resolutions, using sparse and structured linear algebra techniques, e.g. as described in Albano & La Scala "A Koszul decomposition for the computation of linear syzygies"

- Koszul_cohomology:  
direct computation of some syzygy space or Betti number using Koszul cohomology
